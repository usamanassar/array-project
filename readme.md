# Array Functions Playground

This project is a simple **JavaScript learning playground** that demonstrates how to implement and use common **array operations without relying on built-in methods** like `.push()`, `.pop()`, or `.length`.

It provides **15 array functions**, each with a button in the browser to run and see the result with an explanation.

---

## 🚀 Features

The project includes the following array functions:

1. **Add number** → Add a new number to the end of an array (manual push).
2. **Remove last** → Remove the last element (manual pop).
3. **Get first** → Retrieve the first element of the array.
4. **Get index** → Find the index of a given value.
5. **Get length** → Count array elements without using `.length`.
6. **Reverse array** → Reverse the order of array elements.
7. **Get evens** → Filter only even numbers.
8. **Sum of array** → Calculate the sum of all elements.
9. **Join words** → Join string array into a sentence.
10. **Remove duplicates** → Remove duplicate values.
11. **Find maximum** → Get the largest number.
12. **Find minimum** → Get the smallest number.
13. **Contains value** → Check if a value exists in the array.
14. **Square array** → Square each number in the array.
15. **Merge arrays** → Combine two arrays into one.

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. You will see **15 buttons** – each represents one array function.
4. Click any button to:
   - Show the **input** array.
   - Show the **result** after applying the function.
   - Display an **explanation** of what happened.

## 📸 Example Output

When you click **"Remove duplicates"**:

Input: [1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,3,5,6,7,8]
Result: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Explanation: Removed duplicates

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** for structure
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** for array logic and DOM interaction

No external libraries are required.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Practice writing **array functions manually**.
- Understand how basic array methods work under the hood.
- Gain hands-on experience with **DOM manipulation** (creating buttons, showing results, explanations).

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add **CSS styling** to make the buttons and results look cleaner.
- Replace the button list with a **dropdown selector** for better UI.
- Add more advanced array functions (e.g., sorting, filtering odd numbers, flattening nested arrays).
